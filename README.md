to run the project first clone the project then in the command line run `npm start`.

### side information about the project

I used bootstrap to apply minimum styling also to show a nicer error message for the `name` and `surname`.

I didn't have any backend to get or to post the date. So for the `fetch` the options of the `drop down` I hard coded some options but I provided a mock fetch to demonstrate the functionality of the `fecth`. ALso, for the very same reason I create a mock `fetch` for submiting the form but I log the value of the form in the console.
